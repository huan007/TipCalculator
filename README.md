## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Most of the time I spent on this project was getting to know swift and setting up XCode. Swift was easy to learn as it was similar to C. The most challenging part is setting up XCode. I am a Windows user so it took a while for me to get used to OSX interfaces. It was hard to get the right software because I thought that xCode required developer account but after a bunch of researchs I figured it was free. Getting the simulator to works was challenging because there was a bug comming up everytime I tried to open the software keyboard in iOS. The simulator was extremely slow. I'm glad that I created my first iOS app :D
